# PricePulse

PricePulse is a Python library for retail price optimization using Bayesian regression for price elasticity estimation and quadratic optimization for optimal pricing. The model incorporates hierarchical Bayesian methods, non-linear elasticity, lifecycle-aware pricing, marketing impact, and inventory constraints to maximize revenue, profit and inventory turn while maintaining stock availability

## Features

- **Hierarchical Bayesian Model:** Utilizes partial pooling across product hierarchy to share statistical strength.
- **Non-Linear Price Elasticity:** Incorporates quadratic terms in log-price to capture varying elasticity.
- **Lifecycle Stages:** Accounts for New Product Introduction (NPI), Mature, and End-of-Life (EOL) stages with distinct pricing strategies.
- **Marketing Impact:** Uses an exponential decay prior on lagged marketing spend coefficients.
- **Inventory Constraints:** Prevents stockouts by integrating inventory constraints in the optimization process.

## Self and Cross Price Elasticity Visualization

This software provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing and visualizing self-price elasticity and cross-price elasticity across a hierarchical product structure (Categories ‚Üí Brands ‚Üí SKUs). It is designed to help businesses understand how price changes impact demand at different levels of their product hierarchy and across various lifecycle stages.

## Model Explainability

The library also aims to enhance the price optimizer with explainability features using feature attribution, constraint analysis, and natural language explanations. 

Sample Model Explainability Output :

```python
print(explainer.explain(optimal_price=149.99, style='detailed'))

```

```sh

Key factors in this pricing decision:
1. Price was reduced because demand is highly responsive to price changes (-1.82 elasticity)
2. Product is in mature stage where we prioritize profit maximization
3. Inventory levels healthy (current: 650, max: 1000)
4. Recent marketing spend is contributing 12.4% demand lift

Tradeoff analysis:
At $149.99: 
- Expected profit change: +18.72%
- Inventory turnover: 0.7x
- Price vs competition: -4.25% difference
```


Explanation Features:
- **Causal Factors Considered:**
  - Price elasticity magnitude and direction
  - Lifecycle stage priorities
  - Inventory position analysis
  - Marketing impact quantification
  - Tradeoff visualization between pricing and stock constraints
- **Multiple Explanation Styles:**
  - Simple bullet points for executives
  - Detailed technical breakdown for analysts
  - Visual tradeoff diagrams
- **Contextual Comparisons:**
  - Price position vs competitors
  - Inventory health status
  - Marketing contribution window

## üìå Usage (Refer to Jupyter_Script_for_Analysts.ipynb)

Step 1: Generate Synthetic Data For Testing Purposes
- Designed to simulate real world proprietary data and retail business scenario
- Generates synthetic data to simulate product lifecycle effect on demand, simulates historical marketing efforts, competitor price,item seasonality and item trend 
- Added sku cost dummy data based on lifecycle decay,seasonal supplier deals and Holiday/Event-Driven cost correction
- Added max inventory dummy data based on lead time compensation and pre-event stocking
- Both sku cost and inventory data will used as constraints in the optimization engine

```python
from PricePulse.bayesian_model import *

df = BayesianElasticityModel.generate_dynamic_dummy_data(
    n_categories=3,
    n_brands_per_category=2,
    n_skus_per_brand=3,
    start_date="2023-01-01",
    end_date="2024-12-31",
    lifecycle_stages=["npi", "mature", "eol"],
    lead_time_days=10,
    seed=42
)

```

Step 2: Visualize Product Hierarchy
```python
# Generate and display the chart
chart = BayesianElasticityModel.plot_hierarchical_chart(df)
chart.render('product_hierarchy', format='png', cleanup=True)
chart.render(filename='product_hierarchy', format='png', cleanup=True)
chart

```

Step 3: Generate Self Price and Competitor Cross Price Elasticities

```python
results = BayesianElasticityModel.test_elasticity_model_outputs(df)
self_elasticities = results['self_elasticities']
cross_elasticities = results['cross_elasticities']
```

Step 4: Visualize Price-Demand Relationships across a hierarchical product structure and product lifecycle ( New Product Introduction (NPI), Mature, and End-of-Life (EOL) stages )

```python
BayesianElasticityModel.visualize_demand_projections(results['price_demand_curves'], level='brand', item_id=0)
```
